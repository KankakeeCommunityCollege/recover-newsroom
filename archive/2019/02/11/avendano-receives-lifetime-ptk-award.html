<p><img src="/uploads/john-avendano-dsc-20836.JPG" alt="" class="float-image-left" />Dr. John Avendano, president of Kankakee Community College, has been selected for the Michael Bennett Lifetime Achievement Award from <a href="http://www.ptk.org">Phi Theta Kappa</a> honor society.</p>

<p>According to Phi Theta Kappa, recipients are selected based on their “strong support of student success on their campus by recognizing academic achievement, leadership, and service among high-achieving students over the course of their career.” Avendano was nominated by <a href="hppt://www.kcc.edu/ptk">KCC’s Alpha Delta Eta chapter</a> of Phi Theta Kappa.</p>

<p>“We know the depth of each member’s experience has a lot to do with the value placed on Phi Theta Kappa by college leaders,” said Lynn Tincher-Ladner, national president and CEO of Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. “Your nomination and selection for this award is recognition that your Phi Theta Kappa students have your support.”</p>

<p>Avendano will be honored at Phi Theta Kappa’s “Catalyst 2019” national convention, April 5. He is one of just seven college presidents who will receive the award.</p>

<p>“Our chapter has continually been supported and encouraged by Dr. Avendano during the 10 years of his presidency,” said Susan LaMore, KCC Alpha Delta Eta chapter adviser. “He has supported the chapter from the start. He takes time to welcome members at induction ceremonies, and always remarks about the value and benefits of participation.</p>

<p>“We are proud to be a five star chapter, marking the highest level of participation in the organization. Dr. Avendano’s support and pride in this accomplishment are appreciated.”</p>

<p>“Receiving this award is truly special,” Avendano said. “I’ve been fortunate to be a part of dozens of Phi Theta Kappa inductions and events, and the energy is positive, engaging, and contagious. Internationally, Phi Theta Kappans are the best and the brightest honor society students. I also know from personal experience how it makes a difference, because both of my daughters were members and officers at KCC. Their college experience was greatly enhanced by Phi Theta Kappa and I’m proud of all of them! Again, this is truly an honor.”</p>

<p>The lifetime achievement award is Avendano’s third national Phi Theta Kappa Award. In 2013, he received the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction for outstanding efforts given to those who promote the goals of Phi Theta Kappa. In 2009, he received the Phi Theta Kappa Distinguished Administrator Award while he worked at Illinois Central College. From 2010-13, Avendano served as the liaison between the Illinois Council of Community College Presidents and the Illinois Region of Phi Theta Kappa.</p>

<p>Himself a community college graduate, Avendano also is an honorary member of Phi Theta Kappa at KCC.</p>

<p>Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic achievement at associate degree-granting colleges since 1918. It also is the largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 3.5 million members and nearly 1,300 chapters in 10 nations.</p>

<p>The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship. To be eligible for membership, students must have a 3.5 grade point average or better on a 4.0 scale.<br />The Michael Bennett Lifetime Achievement Award is named in honor of the late Dr. Michael Bennett, longtime president of St. Petersburg College in Florida.</p>
