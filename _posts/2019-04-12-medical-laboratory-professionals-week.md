![](/uploads/med-lab-week-150x150.jpg){: .float-image-right}Medical Laboratory Professionals Week will be observed nationally April 21-27, 2019.&nbsp;

This week recognizes the contributions of the laboratory professionals whose work in medical laboratories help give our nation the best possible health care.&nbsp;

"These medical laboratory personnel play an increasingly vital role in the diagnosis and prevention of disease; and often their dedicated efforts are unseen as they work behind the scenes," said Glenda Forneris, director of KCC's Medical Laboratory Technology program.

"Every day physicians and other healthcare workers depend on laboratory professionals to perform tests on blood and other body fluids, interpret the results, and help provide a complete picture of a patient's health," Forneris said.&nbsp;

Using modern biomedical equipment and complicated analysis, these professionals can detect the presence of cancer, identify infectious viruses and bacteria, and measure glucose, cholesterol, or drug levels in blood.

"Without this precise and valuable information, medicine would simply become guesswork," Forneris said.

KCC Medical Laboratory Technology students will have a display table Tuesday, April 16 from 10 a.m. - noon to share information about the profession and the program. There will also be an opportunity to try your hand at performing a few "lab tests."

KCC offers a two-year [Medical Laboratory Technology associate degree](hhttp://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Academic-Catalog/Program-Areas/Health-Careers/Medical-Laboratory-Technology-AAS){: target="_blank"} as well as an [advanced placement degree](http://kcc.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Academic-Catalog/Program-Areas/Health-Careers/Medical-Laboratory-Technology-Advanced-Placement-Sequence-Option-1){: target="_blank"} for qualified students who have already completed general education requirements.
