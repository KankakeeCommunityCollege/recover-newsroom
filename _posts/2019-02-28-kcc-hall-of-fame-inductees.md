The number of Hall of Fame members at Kankakee Community College is expanding this spring.

In all, four individuals and a full team are being inducted into two different halls of fame.

Denson has coached the Lady Cavaliers since the 2000-01 season. His teams have appeared in 13 NJCAA Div. II National Tournaments, finishing as runners-up in 2007 and 2008. Overall, Denson’s coaching record is 476 wins and 152 losses; and his teams have 15 seasons with 20 or more wins.

Former Women’s Basketball Head Coach Paul ![](/uploads/paul-oconnor-dsc3248rt.jpg){: .float-image-right}O’Connor also is being inducted into the IBCA Hall of Fame. O’Connor coached the Lady Cavs from 1986 to 2000. His teams appeared in nine NJCAA Div. II National Tournaments, winning the championship in 1995 and finishing second in 1993 and 1996. O’Connor compiled seven consecutive 20-win seasons and retired from coaching with 409 wins and 63 losses. He was inducted in to the Region IV Hall of Fame in 2002.

The 1994-95 team O’Connor coached to a national championship also is being inducted into the IBCA Hall of Fame. That team earned KCC’s first athletics national title by winning a 94-89 triple overtime thriller against St. Clair County Community College of Michigan. The Lady Cavs finished that season with 34 wins and 2 losses. The team was sophomores Wendy Dieterlen, Kristen Reeves, Kerri Bartlow, Alicia Harkins, Allison Young and Beth Brown; and freshmen Sandra Lamphear, Amy Kieckbusch, Angie Cacello, Jennifer Noel, Jennifer Roberts and Melissa Chasensky. Kieckbusch was named the national tournament most valuable player. O’Connor’s assistant coach was Larry Huffman. Athletic trainers were Donnie Denson—who later become the head coach—and Yvonne Mills.
